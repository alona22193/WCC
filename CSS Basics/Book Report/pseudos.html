    In this week's reading group, we read <em>Their Eyes Were Watching God</em>, a 1937 novel and the best known work by African-American writer Zora Neale Hurston. This novel narrates main character Janie Crawford's ripening from a vibrant, but voiceless, teenage girl into a woman with her finger on the trigger of her own destiny.
